<INSTRUCTIONS>
- The summary must capture the main real-world semantic concepts and relationships defined, described or constrained by the original text.
- The summary must be concise, ideally up to 100 words.
- The summary must first briefly mention core semantic concepts and relationships, then provide a more detailed explanation of the text if there is some space left.
- The summary must directly summarize the text. It is prohibited to:
  --- refer to the original text as "the text" or "the document"
  --- start with "Summary of" or similar phrases,
  --- include text such as "Short summary of", "Detailed explanation of", etc.
  --- include legal jargon, citations, or references.
- The summary must be in the same language as the given text.
